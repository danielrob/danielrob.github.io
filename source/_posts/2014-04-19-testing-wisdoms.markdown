Three months into being a test engineer I was placed with a senior test engineer with more years experience than my age. In navigating the complexity of the software world (which I did not have a background in) and testing itself, he provided me with many basic gems which generally helped me to take a less flustered approach, and "Keep it simple stupid".

>"What is this?"
"How does it work?"
"Why are we doing it?",
And only then: "Ok! Let's test it!"

>"Complexity is a sign that something is not yet well understood."

>"Testers go where developers fear to tread"

>"QA - Products, QMS - Processes"

>"People, Process, Tools." 

>"You can't test quality into your product"

And just an ism or two of his: 
>Now we're getting into the realm of speculation... 

>"What I lack in speed, I make up for in wisdom" - as he pottered away at testing

## My personal summary: 

- Don't just dive into testing something, take time to understand its context, (you may find issues before you even start to test it)
- If you want quality, you need a quality process. Watch where you spend your time - it may be better to improve a process than heavily test its result. 
- Don't be afraid of complexity, but probably don't accept it either.
- Spend your time focusing on actualities, spike possibilities, and if you are speculating you're probably wasting your time in a meeting.
